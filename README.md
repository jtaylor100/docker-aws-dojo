# docker-aws-dojo

[Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) docker image with:
   * [awscli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli)
   * [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3)
   * make
   * [saml2aws](https://github.com/Versent/saml2aws)
   * [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke)
   * ecs-cli

Based on alpine docker image.

## Usage

1. Install [Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/#installation)
2. Provide a Dojofile:
```
$ cat Dojofile
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/aws-dojo:0.6.0"
```
3. Enter a docker container by running `dojo` in the same directory as Dojofile.
4. Example commands to run inside the Dojo created container:
```
aws --version
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=ec2-ansible-test"
```

## Configuration
If the directory `$HOME/.aws` exists locally, then it will be read-only mounted into a Dojo Docker container. This is how we can provide AWS credentials to the Dojo Docker container.
